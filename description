DarkWeb Scanner – Real-Time Threat Intelligence Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
DarkWeb Scanner is a web-based threat intelligence platform designed to simulate the monitoring of cyber threats posted on dark web forums. It enables users (e.g., cybersecurity analysts or students) to explore various types of threats such as credential leaks, malware sales, payment fraud, and phishing kits — all via an interactive and searchable dashboard.

This project is ideal for demonstrating dark web threat detection concepts and can be a great showcase for cybersecurity students.
